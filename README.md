# throttle

Throttling:
Throttling limits the execution of a function to a specified interval. This means the function will be executed at most once in that time frame, regardless of how often the event is triggered. 

# It's useful for:
Scroll events: Update elements or load data only at certain scroll intervals to optimize performance.
Mouse movement: Track mouse position at regular intervals instead of on every pixel moved.
